# ERC721 Rental & Marketplace Smart Contracts

## Overview

This project introduces the ERC721 Rental concept, incorporating the IERC4907 standard for rentable NFTs. The platform enables users to rent and trade these NFTs in a decentralized manner. Additionally, a marketplace is implemented to facilitate the buying and selling of rentable NFTs using ERC20 tokens.

## Features

- **IERC4907 Standard**: Adheres to the IERC4907 standard for enhanced rentability of ERC721 tokens.
- **Rental Concept**: Introduces the ability for users to rent out and rent in ERC721 tokens securely.

### Decentralized Marketplace

- **Buy and Sell NFTs**: Enables users to buy and sell rentable NFTs using ERC20 tokens.
- **Complete Decentralization**: The marketplace operates entirely on smart contracts, ensuring a decentralized and trustless environment.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: Smart contracts are developed in Solidity, incorporating the IERC4907 standard for ERC721 rentals.
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: Integrates ERC20 tokens for seamless and secure financial transactions within the marketplace.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Leverages blockchain technology for decentralized and transparent execution of smart contracts.
